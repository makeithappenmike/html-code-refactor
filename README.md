# Code Refactor Starter Code

This project is all about accessibility. It's a focus on ensuring that your app/site is easy to read and navigate for all regardless of sight, hearing, etc.. abilities. There are a variety of things that can be done, including but not limited to:

- Adding alt tags to images with links
- Adding hover effects to links (such as underlines or noticable color shade changes)
- Adding site titles
- Keeping code well structured
- Using correct HTML and CSS structure

This was a great reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML

We were given an existing site and asked to improve accessbility.
